The tiles below show the circles (loci) of constant impedance magnitude and constant reflection coefficient intersecting at the complex load impedance. This is shown simultaneously on a Smith Chart and the X-Y Impedance (Resistance & Reactance) plane. 
Either tile can be clicked/dragged to explore the relationship between the two views, or to see how the intersection appears for different cases.
