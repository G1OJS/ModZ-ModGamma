    The tiles below show the circles (loci) of constant impedance magnitude and constant reflection coefficient intersecting at the complex load impedance. This is shown simultaneously on a Smith Chart and the X-Y Impedance (Resistance & Reactance) plane. 
<br><br>
Either tile can be clicked/dragged to explore the relationship between the two views, or to see how the intersection appears for different cases.

  An RF resistance bridge used in a typical antenna analyser measures only the modulus of the impedance and the modulus of the reflection coefficient, and mathematically converts these to the complex load impedance. This visualiser demonstrates why these instruments are sensitive to measurement error when reactance is close to zero; in this region, a small error in the radius of either circle will move the impedance point significantly, and if the mod gamma circle appears to be too small, a solution can't be found because the loci don't intersect.
